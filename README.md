## Your Task

The obejective of this challenge was to creat a portfolio page from scratch that showcases the skills accuired so far and apply them in practice.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work.

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## What I Learned
  We focused on advanced CSS this week.
  
  With a focus on wireframing, CSS slectors, in-box styling, flexbox, media queries, pseudo-classes and other CSS variables. 

  Following on from last week, colaboration is definately key and to speak up and ask questions within the lectures.

  ## What Problems Did we Solve?
  I created a HTML, CSS and README file from scratch. 
  
  As this was only week number two, this proved to be a difficult task. However working through the challenge and overcoming this, afforded a very satisfying result.
